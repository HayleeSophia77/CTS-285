-what worked: The board was the most helpful at being able to visualize the stories and how they work with the steps that needed to be done for the project.
-what did not work:  The lack of communication and understanding of what needed to be done.
-What to do differently:  Ability to communicate with other group members better through discord and ability to share with GitHub.  Use of board with a different post structure so it is easier to follow. 
-Next Steps â€“ Test code and combine the different options.
